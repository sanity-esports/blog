title: 'Esports And Brand Partnerships: A Win-Win Collaboration'
---

Okay, let’s get right to it. The goal is to make both parties happy. A sponsor is
supportive of t he Esports team, but the Sponsor needs to associate itself with someone of
interest. If the Sponsor sees no need to support the Esports team or company, they won’t.
You must pique their interest to be a part of the big collaborative effort. The big win.
One benefit that both parties would receive in partnership is exposure. Association with a
good company or team would bring credibility and a greater audience. Brands create
partnerships with events, organizations, or players. The sponsorship will involve funding,
logos, marketing, etc. Brands will collaborate with Esports influencers to promote a
product or service. With Esports' tremendous growth in popularity, brands recognize this
as a way to drive sales, building both Esports and the brand through the public eye.
Esports viewers will see the product or service promoted by the influencer, leading them to
make a purchase of the brand's product or service. An example of a brand partnership in
Esports would be Ninja partnered with Adidas. Ninja is a popular and top-ranking twitch
streamer. Another example is Coca-Cola partnered with League of Legends and FIFA
eWorld Cup. A few leading sponsorships are AT\&T, Bud Light, Honda, and Mercedes-Benz.
These sponsors are known for their vigorous support in Esports.

Mercedes is a German car brand which partnered with the League of Legends World
Championship in 2023. Mastercard is partnered with RIOT games and has supported them
through global events in the game Valorant. Attract sponsors like this by marketing
yourself, get help from local businesses, display your value, leverage social media,
network, and stay in close contact with different associations. You can start a club or join
one and build those crucial relationships with people of the same interests as you.
Join a streaming network. This will increase your visibility to be offered a sponsorship. You
will get exposure by views, and you can collaborate with other streamers as well. Your
collaboration will give you more exposure where you can promote your product or service.
Sponsors will see your value and provide their support. All you have to do is your part.
Create a plan and execute it. Day by day you will continue to grow in your craft. Others will
invest when they see your worth, so keep going
