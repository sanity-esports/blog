title: Building A Successful Esports Team
---

Okay, let’s build our best team! We will incorporate everything that goes into being one of the
best competitors in Esports. We will analyze the game. We will find what works and overcome
our obstacles together. Are you ready?
Firstly, we need to identify skilled players. Players that add to the team and complement one
another. If one player is flawed in one area, then the other picks him up in that same area. So, we
need to build team chemistry. We will get to know our team members, learn their flaws, their
strengths, and improve as a unit. Communication is a key point in good teamwork. Speaking well
with each other, making sure we have a good understanding of our peers and knowing them as a
person helps greatly.
Resources are needed for training. Equipment like PC builds, graphics cards, keyboards,
mice, monitors, speakers, controls, software, etc. Investment in top shelf gaming tech is crucial
to succeeding in this sport. A few key skills for gaming include coordination, social, cognitivetactical, emotional control, and volition. These competencies are essential to gaming. Other
factors that would determine skill would be age, gender, and genes. Scout talent via online
presence or through open tournaments.
In order to get scouted, you should stream yourself and network with Esports teams. Get
the respect of scouts by attending major events. Be able to hold your own in solo play. Scouts
look for talent in solo queue play. Players are matched up randomly, getting the attention of the
scout by their wins. There is also a list of top players provided by League of Legends. Platforms
like Twitch attract scouts through streaming. As a scout you do not have to watch for hours or
travel constantly to find talent in Esports. It’s as simple as sitting at home using your laptop or
phone. If you would like to travel around and see the world while you search, you can, but do
what works best for you.
Taking these key points into account, your team can become one of the greatest. Choose
the game you want to compete in and let it be your focus. Eventually, after mastering that space,
you can branch out into other areas. Compete in multiple games and conquer the Esports world
with your knowledge. Your team will progress in every way, just make sure everyone is
consistent. Now, get out there and put your team together!
